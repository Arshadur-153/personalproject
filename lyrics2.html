    Tonight
    I just want to take you higher
    Throw your hands up in the sky
    Let's set this party off right

    Players, put yo' pinky rings up to the moon
    Girls, what y'all trying to do?
    Twenty four karat magic in the air
    Head to toe so player
    Look out, uh

    Pop pop, it's show time (show time)
    Show time (show time)
    Guess who's back again?
    Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
    Oh they don't know? (Go on tell 'em)
    I bet they know soon as we walk in (showin' up)
    Wearing Cuban links (ya)
    Designer minks (ya)
    Inglewood's finest shoes (whoop, whoop)
    Don't look too hard might hurt ya'self
    Known to give the color red the blues

    Oh shit, I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket (keep up)
    So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket (keep up)
    Why you mad, fix ya face, ain't my fault y'all be jocking (keep up)

    Players only, come on
    Put your pinky rings up to the moon
    Girls, what y'all trying to do?
    Twenty four karat magic in the air
    Head to toe so player
    Uh, look out!

    Second verse for the hustlas (hustlas) gangstas (gangstas)
    Bad bitches and ya ugly ass friends (haha)
    Can I preach? (Uh oh) can I preach? (Uh oh)
    I gotta show 'em how a pimp get it in
    First, take your sip (sip), do your dip (dip)
    Spend your money like money ain't shit (whoop, whoop)
    We too fresh
    Got to blame in on Jesus
    Hashtag blessed, they ain't ready for me

    I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket (keep up)
    So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket (keep up)
    Why you mad, fix ya face, ain't my fault y'all be jocking (keep up)

    Players only, come on
    Put your pinky rings up to the moon
    Hey girls
    What y'all trying to do? (What y'all trying to do?)
    Twenty four karat magic in the air
    Head to toe so player
    Uh, look out!

    everywhere I go they be like
    Ooh, so player
    Everywhere I go they be like (ooh, so player, ooh)
    Oh everywhere I go they be like (ooh, so player, ooh)

    Now, now, now watch me break it down like (uh)
    Twenty four karat, twenty four karat magic
    What's that sound (twenty four karat, twenty four karat magic)
    Come on now

    Twenty four karat, twenty four karat magic
    Don't fight the feeling, invite the feeling

    Just put your pinky rings up to the moon
    Girls, what y'all trying to do? (Tell me what y'all trying to do)
    Twenty four karat magic in the air
    Head to toe so player (hands up!)
    Put your pinky rings up to the moon
    Girls, what y'all trying to do? (Do)
    Twenty four karat magic in the air
    Head to toe so player (twenty four karat) uh, look out
