<p style="color: aliceblue;">It's not a bad looking game by any measure. The textures are a slightly more muted than Red Dead Redemption 2 or any Naughty Dog game (best looking games out there), but the beauty of it rests within its colors.</p>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">Ghost of Tsushima is, though, very GPU demanding, especially with the graphics set to High or Very High. That final preset doesn't max out some of the quality settings, such as shadows, volumetric fog, and ambient occlusion.</p>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">While not 100% accurate, Ghost of Tsushima is actually based on true historical events, chronicling the first Mongol invasion of Japan in which the island of Tsushima was occupied by the Yuan invasion force.</p>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">The invasion force landed first on Tsushima Island in November 1274, where the local samurai force was overwhelmed. The Mongols, with their distinct style of warfare, which included the use of explosive projectiles, were a daunting adversary. From Tsushima, they moved onto Iki Island, also achieving victory.

<h1 style="color:rgb(255, 72, 0)">Techniques</h1>
<hr>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">Jin Sakai can learn various techniques throughout the game. Technique points, obtained by increasing one's own legend ranking and liberating Mongol territory, are used to learn new techniques. There are three types of techniques categorized in the game menu: samurai, stance and Ghost. The weather in Tsushima slowly changes during exploration depending on how much Jin has used samurai or Ghost techniques. A samurai-based approach results in clearer weather while a Ghost-based approach results in more thunderstorms instead.

<h1 style="color:rgb(255, 72, 0)">Armors and Weapons</h1>
<hr>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">It should be noted that only armor sets will provide Jin with different abilities and perks; all other gear is purely cosmetic. The different armor equipped favors the style of gameplay â€“ for example, archery fans might prefer Tadayori's Armor and fans of stand-offs might prefer the Sakai Clan Armor.</p>
<p style="color: aliceblue;">The Sakai Katana and Tanto are the main melee weapon used by Jin throughout the game. No other melee weapons are acquired or used, despite the numerous other types that are seen such as Norio's naginata or the Mongol shields and spears.The general consensus is that the Kunai and Smoke Bomb are considered the best weapons, with the Kunai being ranked first by most commenters.</p>
